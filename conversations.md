## Jingle Ringford
Welcome! Hop in the gondola to take a ride up the mountain to Exit 19: Santa's castle!

Santa asked me to design the new badge, and he wanted it to look really cold - like it was frosty.

Click your badge (the snowflake in the center of your avatar) to read your objectives.

If you'd like to chat with the community, join us on Discord!

We have specially appointed Kringle Koncierges as helpers; you can hit them up for help in the #general channel!

If you get a minute, check out Ed Skoudis' official intro to the con!

Oh, and before you head off up the mountain, you might want to try to figure out what's written on that advertising bilboard.

Have you managed to read the gift list at the center?

It can be hard when things are twirly. There are tools that can help!

It also helps to select the correct twirly area.

...

Great work with that! I'm sure you'll be able to help us with more challenges up at the castle!

...


## Santa
Hello and welcome to the North Pole!

We’re super excited about this year’s KringleCon 3: French Hens.

My elves have been working all year to upgrade the castle.

It was a HUGE construction project, and we’ve nearly completed it.

Please pardon the remaining construction dust around the castle and enjoy yourselves!

...

Welcome to my newly upgraded castle!

Also, check out that big portrait behind me!

https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2020/assets/img/santa_portrait.jpg

I received it in the mail a couple of weeks ago – a wonderful house warming present from an anonymous admirer.

Gosh, I wonder who sent it. I’m so thankful for the gift!

Please feel free to explore my upgraded castle and enjoy the KringleCon talks upstairs.

You can get there through my new Santavator!

...

## Jewel Loggins
Welcome to the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2020! Have a great time!

Be sure to join us on Discord!

Remember, you can get hints for each of the objectives in your badge by clicking on elves.

If you help elves solve their own technical terminal challenge, they’ll give you some ideas about how to approach the objectives.

Oh, and if you see any odd objects lying around, walk over to them to pick them up!

You might even find one as you approach the castle!

...


## Shinny Upatree
Hiya hiya - I'm Shinny Upatree!

Check out this cool KringleCon kiosk!

You can get a map of the castle, learn about where the elves are, and get your own badge printed right on-screen!

Be careful with that last one though. I heard someone say it's "ingestible." Or something...

Do you think you could check and see if there is an issue?

...

Golly - wow! You sure found the flaw for us!

Say, we've been having an issue with an Amazon S3 bucket.

Do you think you could help find Santa's package file?

Jeepers, it seems there's always a leaky bucket in the news. You'd think we could find our own files!

Digininja has a great guide, if you're new to S3 searching.

He even released a tool for the task - what a guy!

The package wrapper Santa used is reversible, but it may take you some trying.

Good luck, and thanks for pitching in!

...



## Pepper Minstix
Howdy - Pepper Minstix here!

I've been playing with tmux lately, and golly it's useful.

Problem is: I somehow became detached from my session.

Do you think you could get me back to where I was, admiring a beautiful bird?

If you find it handy, there's a tmux cheat sheet you can use as a reference.

I hope you can help!

...

You found her! Thanks so much for getting her back!

Hey, maybe I can help YOU out!

There's a Santavator that moves visitors from floor to floor, but it's a bit wonky.

You'll need a key and other odd objects. Try talking to Sparkle Redberry about the key.

For the odd objects, maybe just wander around the castle and see what you find on the floor.

Once you have a few, try using them to split, redirect, and color the Super Santavator Sparkle Stream (S4).

You need to power the red, yellow, and green receivers with the right color light!

...



## Piney Sappington
Psssst!

Hey you! Yes YOU!

I’ve gotta tell you something, but you gotta keep it on the down-low.

Santa has been behaving VERY strangely over the past couple of weeks.

He has delayed certain projects, cancelled others, and even messed around with our technical infrastructure.

There’s rumors among the elves that something has gone wrong with Santa.

I can’t say any more – he might hear!

...




## Ribb Bonbowford
Hello - my name is Ribb Bonbowford. Nice to meet you!

Are you new to programming? It's a handy skill for anyone in cyber security.

This challenge centers around JavaScript. Take a look at this intro and see how far it gets you!

Ready to move beyond elf commands? Don't be afraid to mix in native JavaScript.

Trying to extract only numbers from an array? Have you tried to filter?

Maybe you need to enumerate an object's keys and then filter?

Getting hung up on number of lines? Maybe try to minify your code.

Is there a way to push array items to the beginning of an array? Hmm...

...

Wow - are you a JavaScript developer? Great work!

Hey, you know, you might use your JavaScript and HTTP manipulation skills to take a crack at bypassing the Santavator's S4.

...


## Sparkle Redberry
Hey hey, Sparkle Redberry here!

The Santavator is on the fritz. Something with the wiring is grinchy, but maybe you can rig something up?

Here's the key! Good luck!

On another note, I heard Santa say that he was thinking of canceling KringleCon this year!

At first, I thought it was a joke, but he seemed serious. I’m glad he changed his mind.

Have you had a chance to look at the Santavator yet?

With that key, you can look under the panel and see the Super Santavator Sparkle Stream (S4).

To get to different floors, you'll need to power the various colored receivers.

... There MAY be a way to bypass the S4 stream.

...


## Ginger Breddie
Hey, I heard from some of the other elves that there's some really crazy things going on with floor one and a half.

...


## Chimney Scissorsticks
* [Terminal: Greeting Cards](terminals.md#greeting-cards)

Hello hello, I'm Chimney Scissorsticks!

Feel free to use this greeting card generator to create some holiday messages which you can share online!

It's based closely on the code used in the Tag Generator - in the wrapping room.

I hear that one's having some issues, but this one seems A-OK.

...


## Bow Ninecandle
You know what Santa just told me?

He said he thought of yet another marketing pitch for the North Pole.

He wants to call it, "The Frostiest Place on Earth!"

What’s with that?

...


## Jack Frost
Gosh, there's some really great talks.

I'm getting all kinds of ideas for different modes of attack.

...

Hi, I'm Jack Frost!

Just hanging out here at The Frostiest Place on Earth.

...

That's such a magnificent portrait of Santa in the foyer.

What a great demonstration of artistic skill.

Bwahahaha!

...


## Bushy Evergreen
* [Terminal: Speaker UNPrep](terminals.md#speaker-unprep)

Ohai! Bushy Evergreen, just trying to get this door open.

It's running some Rust code written by Alabaster Snowball.

I'm pretty sure the password I need for ./door is right in the executable itself.

Isn't there a way to view the human-readable strings in a binary file?

...


## Alabaster Snowball
* [Terminal: Scapy Prepper](terminals.md#scapy-prepper)

Welcome to the roof! Alabaster Snowball here.

I'm watching some elves play NetWars!

Feel free to try out our Scapy Present Packet Prepper!

If you get stuck, you can help() to see how to get tasks and hints.

...


## Wunorse Openslae
* [Terminal: CAN-Bus Investigation](terminals.md#can-bus-investigation)

Hiya hiya - I'm Wunorse Openslae!

I've been playing a bit with CAN bus. Are you a car hacker?

I'd love it if you could take a look at this terminal for me.

I'm trying to figure out what the unlock code is in this CAN bus log.

When it was grabbing this traffic, I locked, unlocked, and locked the doors one more time.

It ought to be a simple matter of just filtering out the noise until we get down to those three actions.

Need more of a nudge? Check out Chris Elgee's talk on CAN traffic!

...


## Minty Candycane
* [Terminal: Sort-O-Matic](terminals.md#sort-o-matic)

Hey there, KringleCon attendee! I'm Minty Candycane!

I'm working on fixing the Present Sort-O-Matic.

The Sort-O-Matic uses JavaScript regular expressions to sort presents apart from misfit toys, but it's not working right.

With some tools, regexes need / at the beginning and the ends, but they aren't used here.

You can find a regular expression cheat sheet [here](https://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/javascript) if you need it.

You can use [this](https://regex101.com/) regex interpreter to test your regex against the required Sort-O-Matic patterns.

Do you think you can help me fix it?

...

Great job! You make this look easy!

Hey, have you tried the Splunk challenge?

Are you newer to SOC operations? Maybe check out his [intro talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbIhHhRKQCw) from last year.

Dave Herrald is doing a [great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxVgEFt08kU) on tracking adversary emulation through Splunk!

Don't forget about useful tools including [Cyber Chef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) for decoding and decrypting data!

It's down in the Great Room, but oh, they probably won't let an attendee operate it.

...


## Noel Boetie
* [Terminal: Tag Generator]()

I'm Noel Boetie. Welcome to the Wrapping Room!

We wrap presents and tag them for delivery here.

Unfortunately, the tag generator is acting up.

I'm hoping Santa can give me a hand nailing down that flaw.

...


## Tinsel Upatree
GOSHGOLLY

How did you get in here??

I mean, hey, I'm impressed you made it in here, but you've got to leave!

Breaking into Santa's office might mean immediate membership on the wrong side of the Naughty/Nice List.

...


## Bubble Lightington
Santa doesn’t seem to be his kind self lately.

It’s like something’s gotten into him.

Must be stress.

...


## Sugarplum Mary
* [Terminal: Linux Primer](terminals.md#linux-primer)

Sugarplum Mary? That's me!

I was just playing with this here terminal and learning some Linux!

It's a great intro to the Bash terminal.

If you get stuck at any point, type hintme to get a nudge!

Can you make it to the end?

...

You did it - great! Maybe you can help me configure my postfix mail server on Gentoo!

Just kidding!

Hey, wouldja' mind helping me get into my point-of-sale terminal?

It's down, and we kinda' need it running.

Problem is: it is asking for a password. I never set one!

Can you help me figure out what it is so I can get set up?

Shinny says this might be an Electron application.

I hear there's a way to extract an ASAR file from the binary, but I haven't looked into it yet.

...
