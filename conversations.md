We have specially appointed Kringle Koncierges as helpers; you can hit them up for help in the #general channel!
If you get a minute, check out Ed Skoudis' official intro to the con!
Oh, and before you head off up the mountain, you might want to try to figure out what's written on that advertising bilboard.
Have you managed to read the gift list at the center?
It can be hard when things are twirly. There are tools that can help!
It also helps to select the correct twirly area.

Great work with that! I'm sure you'll be able to help us with more challenges up at the castle!
