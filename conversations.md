Welcome! Hop in the gondola to take a ride up the mountain to Exit 19: Santa's castle!

Santa asked me to design the new badge, and he wanted it to look really cold - like it was frosty.

Click your badge (the snowflake in the center of your avatar) to read your objectives.

If you'd like to chat with the community, join us on Discord!

We have specially appointed Kringle Koncierges as helpers; you can hit them up for help in the #general channel!

If you get a minute, check out Ed Skoudis' official intro to the con!

Oh, and before you head off up the mountain, you might want to try to figure out what's written on that advertising bilboard.

Have you managed to read the gift list at the center?

It can be hard when things are twirly. There are tools that can help!

It also helps to select the correct twirly area.

...

Great work with that! I'm sure you'll be able to help us with more challenges up at the castle!

Hello and welcome to the North Pole!

We’re super excited about this year’s KringleCon 3: French Hens.

My elves have been working all year to upgrade the castle.

It was a HUGE construction project, and we’ve nearly completed it.

Please pardon the remaining construction dust around the castle and enjoy yourselves!

Welcome to the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2020! Have a great time!

Be sure to join us on Discord!

Remember, you can get hints for each of the objectives in your badge by clicking on elves.

If you help elves solve their own technical terminal challenge, they’ll give you some ideas about how to approach the objectives.

Oh, and if you see any odd objects lying around, walk over to them to pick them up!

You might even find one as you approach the castle!

Hiya hiya - I'm Shinny Upatree!

Check out this cool KringleCon kiosk!

You can get a map of the castle, learn about where the elves are, and get your own badge printed right on-screen!

Be careful with that last one though. I heard someone say it's "ingestible." Or something...

Do you think you could check and see if there is an issue?
